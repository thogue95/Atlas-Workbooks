# Atlas-Workbooks
Atlas Workbooks for Iracing 

Update:  This Atlas directory contains a workbook that was setup for oval racing in iRacing.  Our current focus on oval cars is NextGen, Trucks, Sk Modifieds and Nascar Tour Modifieds.  This should help in provide some context as to why the screen is laid out like it is.

In order to get this workbook to come up, you will need to have already installed Atlas. Busters Corner on Youtube has provide a video on how to install this workbook and get Atlas up and running.  Here is the link to the video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp0I3ADXJHs

Important!!!!

You have to copy the workbook AND the "Rake" function file to the correct locations.  2 steps:

1) Copy Oval_Track_Workbook_v3.wbk file into the C:\Documents\McLaren Electronics Systems\Atlas9\Workbooks\ directory.

2) Copy the %RAKE file to the into the C:\Documents\McLaren Electronics Systems\Atlas9\Funclib\ directory.


!!!Important!!!
After you copy the %RAKE file into the directory above, verify that the file STILL has the "%" sympbol in the file name.  

I have seen this character get lost and so you may have to rename the file to restore it to get the rake function to work properly. If you have no data in the rake waveform area then you are most likely missing the function file or it is not named correctly.

Double check the paths as I may have a slight typos.  


When you have loaded the Workbook and Rake function correctly, the workbook should load with blank squares.

Once you get the workbook loaded then you will need to load telemetry session data and then you will get data in the squares.

You will need to "regenerate" the circuit lap by holding your mouse over the circuit lap box and right mouse button click to get the "Regenerate Circuit Lap" option.
